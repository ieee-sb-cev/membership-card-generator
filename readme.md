# IEEE SB CEV - Membership Card Generator

## Project Version : 1.0.0

For generating the badge for now,
you need to be installed with [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en) in your system.

To download the dependencies, use the command in command line.

```javascript
npm install // This will install necessary dependencies to run.
```

---

Better to create a branch for yourself, before changing anything in the code.

To Create a Branch, use terminal / command line,

```javascript
git branch <branch-name> // git branch hafis-cp
git checkout <branch-name> // git checkout hafis-cp
```

---

Later on, for generate a badge for your convenience, you need to do some steps. Open **app.js** file for making the changes.

---

After changing the values, run the JS File.

```ruby
node app.js
```

```ruby
# Browse :

localhost:3000

# as App is listening on the port 3000
```

Play with the Badge Generator.
The output file will be generated on the folder **final-outs**.
